# Project Notes

## Selects as quick-choice combo boxes

Effectively, browsers make them that way already. The UI standards permit us to
just tab into the box and type the name of a choice. There's not all that much
feedback, but who cares? This can actually be lower priority. Moving down in
Trello.

## Character quicksearch filter

This is a more interesting Javascript question. Nothing so interesting it can't
go in Trello though, right?
